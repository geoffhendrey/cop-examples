Our goal in this example is to provide step-by-step insructions for creating a solution which demonstrates asynchronous messaging between two services.

You will learn:

1. Create a service called Bank with a cloud event API
1. Create a service called Client with a cloud event API
1. Package the two services as container images
1. Publish the container images to a container repository
1. Create knowlege objects representing the cloud events used by the services
1. Create knowlege objects called channels referring to the above cloud events
1. Create knowlege objects for subscribing to new events
1. Publish the solution
1. Subscribe to the solution
1. Test the solution by checking the logs
