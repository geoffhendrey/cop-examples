Our goal in this example is to provide step-by-step insructions for creating a solution that contains a custom REST endpoint. 

You will learn:

Create a service with a REST endpoint
Package the service inside a container image
Publish the container image to a container repository
Create a knowlege object to link your solution with the newly create image
Push the solution to the platform
Subscribe to the solution
Test the solution by invoking the new REST API with your platform credentials
